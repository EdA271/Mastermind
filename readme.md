# Mastermind AI
---

This Project is an AI for the game of Mastermind. It is a two or more player game, where one person puts together a "code" compromised of four different colors (from a pool of 8 colors), and the players take turns guessing that "code" each turn, players place 4 pegs on the board, and the person who put together the code tells them how many colors they have correct, and whether or not they are in the right spot.

## Instalaltion:
---
1. Download the repository or the Python file.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.

## Usage:
---
1. Think of a code compromised of 4 different colors from Red, White, Orange, Grey, Pink, Blue, Green, Yellow (No cheating >:( ).
2. Run the Python file.
3. When prompted with a guess, enter the number of colors that are correctly guessed and in the right spot, and the number of colors that are correct but in the wrong spot.
    - For example, if the code is `Red, White, Orange, Grey` and the guess is `Red, White, Pink, Orange`, the input would be `2 1`, since Red and White were correctly guessed and are in the right spot while Orange was correctly guessed, but not in the right spot.
4. Enjoy :)!

Feel free to make my game as hard as you wish. you can add more colors, make the sequence longer, or play with repeated colors. Careful, the AI is pretty good, so don't make it too hard for yourself.
